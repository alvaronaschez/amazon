Rotate Array

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is
non-negative.

Follow up:

Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different
ways to solve this problem.
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?


Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4
It's guaranteed that nums[i] fits in a 32 bit-signed integer.
k >= 0
