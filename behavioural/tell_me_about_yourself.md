# Tell me about yourself

My name is Álvaro Sánchez, I'm a software engineer.\
\
I started my professional carreer 5 years ago as a Java backend developer for Accelya.  
I have learned a lot in that position, but after about two years there I started to feel myself a little stucked and I was curious about what other possibilities could be there for my professional carreer. So I decided to make a change.\
\
I've always loved Computer Science and Algorithms, so I decided to start a Masters Degree in AI. There I started to learn Python, and I felt in love with the language. So in my next job I tried to find something related to that language. That was how I ended up working in Deimos Space where I leaded the technical design and development of a web app using Python. That is currently the achievement that I am most proud of in my career.\
\
After that I've worked for two other companies as a software engineer, where I have done several different things: from develop a REST API using .Net framework, to optimize SQL stored procedures and writing batch scripting for task automation. Also I have touched several technologies as AWS, Microsoft Azure, Raspberry-Pi and Docker.\
\
So now, after having so many different experiences in a so short period of time I feel that I know much better what I want and what I don't. So I'm willing to find a company in which I could remain for a long period of time and to develop a carrer in. And I truly believe that Amazon is the best place., for doing that.


My name is Álvaro Sánchez.
I've been working as a software engineer for the last 5 years, most of the time as a backend developer.
My main language is Python, but I started my carrer programming in Java.
The achivement which I'm most proud of in my carreer is the technical design and development of a web applicacion in the context of Galileo GNSS from the EU.
I'm curious and passionate about my profession. I'm always learning new things, reading books and so. Most of my experience is as a back-end developer, mainly with Python and Java. But also I'm very versatile and I've touched many other different technologies.
